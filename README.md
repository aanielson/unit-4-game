# Crystal Collector Game

## Instructions
This is a guessing game. The player must guess numbers rather than letters.
1. There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
2. The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
3. When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.
    * This amount is hidden until the player clicks a crystal.
    * When they do click one, the player's score counter is updated.
4. The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
5. The player loses if their score goes above the random number.
6. The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
7. When the game begins again, the player will see a NEW random number. Also, all the crystals will have four NEW hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.
8. The app will show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.
